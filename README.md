# Compilation
The files in this repository are part of a larger project, DeepSimulator. In order to use these files:
* Enable Fault simlulation mode and Aproximate multipliers modes in DeepHLS while creating the main function for inference.
* Copy these three files beside the files of the DeepSimulator project before compiling DeepSimulator.
